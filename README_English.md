## Context
In collaboration with **INSEE**, this project was carried out as part of the **National Datavisualization Competition 2025**, organized within the Data Science departments of ***all** IUTs in France*.  
Participants were provided exclusively with **raw data**, with no predefined problem statement, and were required to conduct the entire analytical process autonomously.

<br>

> ❗ **Note**  
> *This project relies on a strong ability in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **interpreting raw data to extract actionable insights**.*

## 🎯 Our objective
We chose to work with **2021 data**, as it is the most recent and allows for the analysis of current social issues.
Our team aimed to analyze **inequalities in the schooling of young people aged 15 to 29 in France**, highlighting territorial and social disparities.  
It is primarily intended for **public decision-makers, researchers, and education stakeholders**, in order to provide a clear and concise reading of complex phenomena based on public data.

---

## ❓ Research question
**What inequalities can be observed in the schooling of 15–29-year-olds in France in 2021, according to territory, gender, and level of education?**

---

## 🛠️ Tools used
- **Excel** (preparation, pivot tables)
- **Tableau** & **Power BI** (visual exploration)
- **Python** (`pandas`, `geopandas`, `matplotlib`)
- **PowerPoint** (final assembly and layout of charts, storytelling structure, writing of descriptive elements, production of the final infographic)


---

## 🔍 Methodology
- Selection and **extraction of relevant columns** from the raw INSEE dataset  
- Creation of a **dedicated Excel file** (*processed data* folder) with hierarchical variables to facilitate analysis  
- Exploratory analysis using **Excel** (pivot tables), **Tableau**, and **Power BI**  
- Advanced analyses and visualizations using **Python** (`pandas`, `geopandas`, `matplotlib`)  
- Merging with geographic data (**GeoJSON**) to produce a **choropleth map**  
- Grouping of visualizations and writing of comments in a **final infographic produced using PowerPoint**
  
---

## 📈 Key results  
- **1 in 5 young people** studies outside their department of birth
- **44.9%** of young people aged 15–29 are enrolled in education in 2021
- Strong **territorial disparities**  
- Marked differences according to **gender** and **level of education**
